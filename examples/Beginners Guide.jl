This is an introduction to using PowerModelsONM, a Julia/JuMP library for optimizing the operations of networked microgrids.

To use PowerModelsONM, you will need to install the package via `Pkg.add()`.

## How to use PowerModelsONM

PowerModelsONM is designed to have a straightforward workflow for optimizing the operation and recovering of distribution feeders under contingencies.

In particular, the workflow consists of sequential steps of

- data processing and preparation, which includes inputs such as
  - the base network (OpenDSS format)
  - timeseries data (contained in the DSS files)
  - events data, which contains the contingencies (json, see `models/events.v1.json`)
  - settings data, which contains supplemental information about the network model not supported in DSS (json, see `models/settings.v1.json`)
  - inverters data, which contains information about inverters for stability analysis (json, see `models/inverters.v1.json` and [PowerModelsStability documentation](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsStability.jl)
  - faults data, which contains pre-built faults over which to iterate during fault studies (json, see `models/faults.v1.json` and [PowerModelsProtection documentation](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsProtection.jl)
- optimal switching (osw) / maximal load delivery (mld) problem
- optimal dispatch (OPF) problem
- statistical analysis and outputs, which includes information about
  - device action timeline, such as the switch configurations at every timestep and which loads have been shed by the algorithm,
  - microgrid statistics, such as min, mean, max voltages, storage state of charge, analysis of load served, analysis of generation sources, etc.
  - Powerflow outputs, which contains dispatch setpoints and bus voltage magnitudes
  - Small signal stability results
  - Fault analysis results

The first and foremost piece of data you will need is the network definition files in OpenDSS format. For more information on what is currently supported see [PowerModelsDistribution](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsDistribution.jl).

Using `parse_network` will return a `network`, which is a "multinetwork" representation of the timeseries contained in the DSS specification, and `base_network`, which is the topological reality of the system, without the expansion into a multinetwork.

multinetworks are data structures which contains a full network definition under `"nw"` with the time varying values written directly to that copy.

Each timestep, or "subnetwork", will be indexed by the string representation of an integer, in order.

For example, the timestep named `"2"`, which corresponds in this case to timestep `2.0` (which you can find under `"mn_lookup"`), can be explored like this:

### Settings

There are many things that cannot be easily represented in the DSS specification, specifically relating to optimization bounds, which is not the use case for OpenDSS. To support specifying these extra types of settings, we have created a settings JSON Schema.

In this example, we load some settings that have been found to fit the loaded data model well.

### Contingencies (Events)

## Analysis

In this next section we will cover the different optimization problems and analyses that we can perform with PowerModelsONM.

### Optimization Solvers

In order to actually solve any of the optimization problems within PowerModelsONM, you will need to initialize some optimization solvers.

PowerModelsONM has several solvers built-in in case you don't want to create your own, and can be created with `build_solver_instances`, which will ouput a Dictionary with

- `"nlp_solver"`: Ipopt
- `"mip_solver"`: HiGHS
- `"lp_solver"`: HiGHS
- `"minlp_solver"`: Juniper
- `"misocp_solver"`: Juniper

### Optimal Switching (osw / mld)

Now that we have a network with contingencies and settings, we want to solve a optimal switching / mld problem.

First, it should be noted that because loads are most typically not individually controllable in distribution feeders, with a few notable exceptions, loads must largely be shed by isolating a load block with switching actions. A load block is defined as a block of buses which can be fully isolated from the grid by opening one or more _operable_ switches.

To accomodate this reality, we can extended PowerModelsDistribution by adding the ability to assign load status variables to multiple loads (_i.e._, by block), and adding constraints that isolate blocks of load that are desired to be shed to maintain operability of the rest of the grid.

Second, the optimal switching problem currently uses the LinDist3Flow model (`PowerModelsDistribution.LPUBFDiagModel`), which is a quadratic approximation, due to the presence of mixed integers.

Finally, the optimial switching problem currently solves sequentially, rather than globally over the entire multinetwork, which means switch configurations and storage energies are manually updated after each timestep is solved.

To run the optimal switching problem, use `optimize_switches`
"""

### Optimal Dispatch (opf)

Because the optimal switching is performed with a) a linear approximation, and b) sequentially, it is advisable to run a separate optimal dispatch solve on the resulting multinetwork

First though, we will want to propagate the switch configuration to the multinetwork data structure using `apply_switch_solutions!`.
"""

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

If you are having trouble getting your network to solve, the first place to look will be the optimization bounds. While DSS is an excellent format for defining networks, including their topology and time series data, it is not intended to define bounds for optimization problems, which is what we are attempting to solve here.

In many cases, the default bounds from DSS are either much too restrictive, such as in the case of line limits, or completely non-existant, such as in the case of bus voltage bounds or line angle different bounds.
